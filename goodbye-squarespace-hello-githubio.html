    <p>TL;DR: I used SquareSpace from 2012 to 2019, but finally made the switch to github.io using Pelican to generate my site.</p>
<p>Sometime in 2012 or 2013, I decided that I needed to register a domain and stand up a site. I had been reading about "personal marketing" to land that sweet sweet job. I bought a domain (you're looking at it), I designed and purchased business cards, then moved on to standing up a web site.</p>
<p>Having worked with LAMP stacks in my day job, I was keen on rolling my own site, and hosting at my apartment in downtown Indianapolis. After a few days of setup, configuration, and general messing around, I realized a very important thing, I am NOT a web developer and I am NOT a web designer. I am a backend, systems engineer.</p>
<p>I looked around for different hosting solutions and I had heard quite a bit about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squarespace">SquareSpace</a>, thanks to all the shows on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision3">Revision3</a> (RIP). I mean, Kevin Rose used it, his site would it the front of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg">Digg</a>, and then never go down. For less than $100 bucks a year, I had a whole host of features and functionality that I thought I would need. Plus, they had amazing, professional templates and a awesome WYSIWYG editor.</p>
<p>Over the next weekend, I looked through all the available templates, figured out what I wanted my site to say about me, and started implementing what would remain my sites look for the duration of my time on the platform. I made it clean with a few pictures of projects I was working on that included little burbs. Setup integration to all my social platforms, then quickly removed most of them. I published my site and felt good about taking my "brand" into my own hands.</p>
<p>Between publishing my site and today, I used my account for my wedding invitations and RSVP process, made a few joke pages (sorry Shawn), and mostly left my site unchanged. Is it worth $100 a year to have a static site that basically just links to your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuarobertbailey/">LinkedIn profile</a> and your rarely touched <a href="https://github.com/binkocd">Github account</a>?</p>
<p>At the end of 2018, I decided I was going to cut down on accounts that I had at various sites. SquareSpace firmly came into view when I received a marketing email.</p>
<p>I looked at why I wanted a website and how I was using it. I wanted a site to show off my skills and help me land that sweet gig that I was promised. Having a static site that "anyone could do" didn't hit those marks to me.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I have been looking into different static site generators. I had some time with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jykell</a> via a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/docker-mastery/">Docker Mastery course on Udemy</a>, but I don't have a lot of Ruby experience. I started looking at Python based projects and finally landed on Pelican. I started a Docker, but I really had no idea how to use <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, let alone how to use it in an undocumented container.</p>
<p>After some easy setup, thanks to <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/">this guide</a>, I started making some basic content. After I got my github.io PoC up, I thought "good enough for what I need" and started rolling everything over from SquareSpace.</p>
<p>My hope is that I can get a decent baseline created and then start to migrate from manual publishing and pushing to some CI/CD process.</p>
