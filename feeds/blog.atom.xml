&lt;p&gt;Sometime in 2012 or 2013, I decided that I needed to register a domain and stand up a site. I had been reading about "personal marketing" to land that sweet sweet job. I bought a domain (you're looking at it), I designed and purchased business cards, then moved on to standing up a web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having worked with LAMP stacks in my day job, I was keen on rolling my own site, and hosting at my apartment in downtown Indianapolis. After a few days of setup, configuration, and general messing around, I realized a very important thing, I am NOT a web developer and I am NOT a web designer. I am a backend, systems engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around for different hosting solutions and I had heard quite a bit about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squarespace"&gt;SquareSpace&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to all the shows on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision3"&gt;Revision3&lt;/a&gt; (RIP). I mean, Kevin Rose used it, his site would it the front of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt;, and then never go down. For less than $100 bucks a year, I had a whole host of features and functionality that I thought I would need. Plus, they had amazing, professional templates and a awesome WYSIWYG editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next weekend, I looked through all the available templates, figured out what I wanted my site to say about me, and started implementing what would remain my sites look for the duration of my time on the platform. I made it clean with a few pictures of projects I was working on that included little burbs. Setup integration to all my social platforms, then quickly removed most of them. I published my site and felt good about taking my "brand" into my own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between publishing my site and today, I used my account for my wedding invitations and RSVP process, made a few joke pages (sorry Shawn), and mostly left my site unchanged. Is it worth $100 a year to have a static site that basically just links to your &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuarobertbailey/"&gt;LinkedIn profile&lt;/a&gt; and your rarely touched &lt;a href="https://github.com/binkocd"&gt;Github account&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2018, I decided I was going to cut down on accounts that I had at various sites. SquareSpace firmly came into view when I received a marketing email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at why I wanted a website and how I was using it. I wanted a site to show off my skills and help me land that sweet gig that I was promised. Having a static site that "anyone could do" didn't hit those marks to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, I have been looking into different static site generators. I had some time with &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jykell&lt;/a&gt; via a &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/docker-mastery/"&gt;Docker Mastery course on Udemy&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't have a lot of Ruby experience. I started looking at Python based projects and finally landed on Pelican. I started a Docker, but I really had no idea how to use &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, let alone how to use it in an undocumented container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some easy setup, thanks to &lt;a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/"&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;, I started making some basic content. After I got my github.io PoC up, I thought "good enough for what I need" and started rolling everything over from SquareSpace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that I can get a decent baseline created and then start to migrate from manual publishing and pushing to some CI/CD process.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="pelican"></category><category term="publishing"></category><category term="github"></category><category term="squarespace"></category></entry><entry><title>Hello World</title><link href="http://binkocd.github.io/hello-world.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-18T19:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-03-18T19:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Josh</name></author><id>tag:binkocd.github.io,2019-03-18:/hello-world.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello world! Starting a blog...again. I'm hoping to use this as a documentation repository for things of interest that I am learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will also, hopefully, be used as a place where I can work out some CI/CD type things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="pelican"></category><category term="publishing"></category></entry></feed>
